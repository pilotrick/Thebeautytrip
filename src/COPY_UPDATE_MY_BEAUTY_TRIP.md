## 📊 A/B Test Hypothesis

### **Old Copy (Transformation/Journey):**
- **Pros:** Aspirational, premium, serious
- **Cons:** Clinical, intimidating, process-heavy
- **Expected CTR:** Moderate

### **New Copy (Vacation/New You):**
- **Pros:** **Fun, exciting, vacation-oriented, personal**
- **Cons:** Less serious (but that might be good!)
- **Expected CTR:** **Higher** (vacation = pleasure trigger)

**Psychology:** People are more likely to book a "vacation" than a "medical journey." The medical benefits become a bonus to the vacation experience!

## 🎁 Bonus Copy Strategy

### **Future Variations to Test:**

1. **"Your Beauty Vacation Awaits"**
2. **"Paradise + The New You"**
3. **"Escape, Relax, Emerge"**
4. **"Vacation Mode: New You Edition"**
5. **"Beach, Bliss, Beauty"**

All focus on **vacation first, beauty second** = lower barrier to entry!
